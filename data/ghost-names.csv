Poltergeist activity is a popular subject in TV in movies, featuring in everything from Blithe Spirit to Harry Potter to the Poltergeist movies."

Stories involving revenants usually depict a specific undead person who returns with a purpose, such as revenge against a killer or those responsible for their death, or to harass people who wronged them during life."
Ringwraith,"(Lord of the Rings): Not technically ghosts, perhaps, but certainly spooky enough to make the list, the Ringwraiths (also known as Nazgûl or Black Riders) began as nine mortal men to whom Sauron gave Rings of Power. The rings gave them power and extended their lives, but it also corrupted and destroyed them, turning them into undead thralls even after their corporeal form faded away."

All we really know is, the Slender Man is terrifying."
Slimer,"(Ghostbusters): Made of pure ectoplasm, Slimer is classified as a focused, non-terminal repeating phantasm, or a Class 5 full roaming vapor (and a real nasty one, at that).

According to the film’s urban legend, he can be summoned by saying his name five times in a mirror, but since we’re talking about Tony Todd with a hook-hand, it’s not recommended."
The Crypt Keeper,"(Tales from the Crypt): In the 50s, the Crypt Keeper started out as the narrator of EC’s horror comic anthology series Tales from the Crypt, until the Comics Code quickly brought about its untimely death. In 1989, however, the character was revived as a cackling animated corpse in order to host the HBO series of the same name. With lines like, “Hello, boils and ghouls!”, the Crypt Keeper’s moldering puns were usually the most deadly part of the show."
Headless Horseman,"(“The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”): In Irving’s classic short story, the Horseman is the ghost of a Hessian soldier decapitated by a cannonball during the American Revolution. While it is suggested in the story that the “spirit” who chases schoolteacher Ichabod Crane might really be Crane’s romantic rival impersonating the ghost to scare him off, the legend of the Headless Horseman remains potent (and if you haven’t seen the Disney adaptation or Christopher Walken’s take on the character in Sleepy Hollow, then you are missing out)."
Tomás,"(El Orfanato/The Orphanage): The protagonist of Spanish suspense/horror film The Orphanage first encounters Tomás as the imaginary friend of her adopted son, Simón—but as events turn sinister, he becomes more of a definite, if ghostly, presence.
